# Abstract

Recently, there has been an increase in the crimes committed . From petty thefts to women's safety issues, it has become near to impossible to monitor every nook and corner of all the streets in the cities.
Although we have a very effective law enforcement systems, there still stands a need for the technology to improve and support this existing system. 
Effective real time monitoring can prevent these crimes from happening.
We plan to introduce a new security mechanism to safeguard the public during abnormal and unsafe activities. 
In this project we aim to implement a smart security system that gives alert to the concerned authority when danger is detected. There is a motion sensor attached to every module. If any motion is detected, the microphone becomes on and records audio. In addition, if there is any danger detected in its vicinity, which is indicated by scream classification of the audio, the camera takes the photos immediately and sends it to the authorities as in the neighbouring police station. This enables the authorities to act swiftly and ensure that necessary steps are taken.
Here we use raspberry pi and pi cam to implement the same.
